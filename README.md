# hello-world
This repository is intended to store work I have generated while working on my game(s).
.
My online alias is TrajedyRaines. I am Male, born June 4, 1985.
My goal with this account is to provide resources for other developers and reference materials to help them develop their own games, using the same sofware I am working with.

At the moment I am working with RPG Maker VX ACE, and will be using RPG Maker MV and IG Maker and potentially down the line their Visual Novel Maker to make manuals and backstory on characters. I also use their Game Character Hub Portfolio Edition to generate sprites and portraits.

The game(s) I'm working on are commercial productions, but anything I personally generate will be added here for everyone to enjoy.
